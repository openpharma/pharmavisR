\title{Generate cohort attrition table}
\usage{
vr_attrition_table(data, criteria_descriptions, criteria_conditions, subject_column_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{r table. It is used as the input data to count the subjects that meets the criteria of interest}

\item{criteria_descriptions}{character vector. It contains the descriptions of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Each element of the vector corresponds to the description of each criterion.}

\item{criteria_conditions}{character vector. It contains the corresponding conditions of the criteria.
These conditions will be used in the table to compute the counts of the subjects.}

\item{subject_column_name}{character. The column name of the table that contains the subject id.}
}
\value{
The counts and percentages of the remaining and excluded subjects for each step of the cohort selection in a table format.
}
\description{
This function calculates the subjects counts for each step of the cohort selection.

By using the description tag you'll notice that I
can have multiple paragraphs in the description section
}
\details{
The vector criteria_descriptions must have the same length with the vector criteria_descriptions
}
\examples{
# create 500 patient ids, with 'lung' or 'breast' as cancer type, aged between 5 and 105 years old
# calculate how many patients have lung cancer patients and subsequently which of them are at least 18 years old.
# cohort <-  dplyr::tibble(patient_id=base::sample(x = 1:1000, size=500), cancer_type=base::sample(c('lung','breast'), 500, replace=T), age=base::sample(x = 5:105, size=500, replace=T))

# Run function
vr_attrition_table(
 data                  = cohort, 
 criteria_conditions   = c("cancer_type=='lung'","age>=18"),
 subject_column_name   = 'patient_id'
) 
}
